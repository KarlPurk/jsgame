jsgame
======

A badly named online multiplayer turn-based game written in JavaScript.

Installation
======
If you have Vagrant installed you can simply run vagrant up in the root directory to launch a new node server running the game.
You can then connect to the game at localhost:1337.

Alternatively just run app.js in node and it will create a server at localhost:1337.
